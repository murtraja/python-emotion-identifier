There are only two ways to succeed in blogging: reading and implementing. If you're not a regular reader of blogs and don't know what's going on around your niche, you can never create a successful blog that makes money.

Reading top blogs is a no brainer if you want to get the latest trends in your industry. Some of my favorite bloggers that I usually read are Indians. And I like to read Indian blogs because I can relate myself with them. It's not like that I do not read other bloggers but still love to read Indians.

A long time ago, in my previous blog, I wrote about some Indian bloggers that you must read in this niche. Today, I am presenting you this list once again. Some of them have kept their places and some have lost out.

This is my personal favorite list and most of these Indian blogs talk about Blogging and how to make money online. I'm inspired by many of them and that's why BloggersPassion is here now.
